tagap_clone
===========

Clone/imitation of the original TAGAP (The Apocalyptic Game About Penguins)
game engine, which is a freeware shoot-em-up platformer game released over a
decade ago.  This alternative engine is written in C and uses Vulkan for
graphics stuff.

This engine aims to be fairly compatible with the original game files and
scripts, although only supports a small subset of TAGAP_Script functionality at
the moment.
The original games files are not provided in this repository, though freeware,
they should be downloaded via the official links to the official game on the
TAGAP website: https://www.tagap.net/down_tagap.htm

The engine is currently quite barebones, and intentionally so; it does NOT aim
to be an *exact* clone of the original engine, but is rather written for fun,
learning purposes, and as an experiment to try some things out that wouldn't be
possible through mere mods to the official game.

Notes:
* Author is not affiliated with Penguin DT in any way.
* No copyright infringement intended.  This software does not claim to be the
  original TAGAP game in any way.  It is simply a game engine that can operate
  using the assets of the original (freeware) game.
* No support for Microsoft Windows garbage as of yet.  Only builds on Linux at
  the moment.
* This is a work in progress, and likely will not feature full functionality
  anytime soon.

Dependencies (not provided as of yet):
* libsdl2 (ensure that Vulkan support is compiled into it)
* cglm
* Vulkan Memory Allocator
* stb_image
* mojoAL (https://github.com/icculus/mojoAL/)

Read the Makefile for info on where to put the dependencies (except SDL2 which
is dynamically linked).
