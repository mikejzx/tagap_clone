tagap_clone
===========

Clone/imitation of the original TAGAP (The Apocalyptic Game About Penguins)
game engine, which is a freeware game released over a decade ago.  This
alternative engine is written in C and uses Vulkan for graphics stuff.

This engine aims to be fairly compatible with the original game files and
scripts, albeit very likely to not support *all* TAGAP_Script functionality.
The game files are not provided in this repository, and must be downloaded via
the official links on the TAGAP website: https://www.tagap.net/down_tagap.htm

The engine is currently quite barebones, and intentionally so; it does NOT aim
to be an *exact* clone of the original engine, but is rather written for fun,
learning purposes, and as an experiment to try some things out that wouldn't be
possible in the official game.

Notes:
* No Windows support as of yet
* Depends on libsdl2 (ensure that Vulkan support is compiled in)
* This is a work in progress, and likely will not feature full functionality
